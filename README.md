# free-librarians-management
This is the software recommended to be use to manage books in the libraries of the Free Librarian movement

## Intro
This program is just one variation of the software to be used in Free Libraries. It is generally recommended to use this program because this will be considered the 'official' software, but it is also recommended to have variation in the community of Free Librarians, so choosing your own *free (and open source)* software is also very good.

Notice: the software used *SHOULD BE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE* or the library cannot be considered a Free Library as it would be -- at least partly -- unfree.

## Features any Free Library management software should have
- A database of existing books with the following columns:
  - Name of the book
  - Name of the author
  - Name of the publisher
  - Edition of the book
  - Category (as used in the library)
  - Subcategory (could be empty if it's not possible to determine it for a certain book)
  - Secondary subcategory (could also be empty)
  - Number of pages
  - Language
  - The state of the book (new or used (in danger, acceptable, good, very good, like new)
  - A code (letters and/or numbers) determining the physical position of the book in the library and depending entirely on the library
- An ability for the Free Librarian to search books in the database the best way possible
- An ability reserved to the Free Library director (or by consensus) to add and remove books
- A wishlist of wanted books with the following feature:
  - Searching books
  - Adding books
  - Removing books (only by the will of the Free Library director or consensus)
- A wishlist not concerning books but other necessary items or services

If features are met, all implementation are good enough, and the variations are a way to have diversity in the community and show the personality of the certain Library.
